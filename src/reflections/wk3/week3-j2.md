# Don't Procrastinate, Encapsulate!


## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation has the main purpose of protection. If we follow the given framework we can ensure that the end user only has access to functions we want then to. This technique secures the program from malicious activity.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Ocasionally these can cause issues if you are not careful with where you are placing them. They automatically change functions and are essentially "live". Beacuse of this, they can be a headache if you don't understand what they are doing.




## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

private functions are written with a _ in front of the function name outside of the exported class. THis adds security.
