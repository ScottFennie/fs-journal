## Vue Lifecycle Hooks

# What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are essentially a look into how the libraries we are using are working to move our data around. With lifecycle hooks, we can see when a component is created, added to a Dom, or altered in any way.

# How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

We have specifically been using the onMounted function as a listener to see if the domain is changed in any way. This let us reload the page with the correct user info.

# What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are essentially listeners. This performs an action when the "thing" it is listening to (mainly data) experiences some kind of change.
