## How To Use Props!

# What are props?

Props are the mechanism we use to "store" data and pass it between our different components that will use it.

# What are props used for?

Props are used for sharing data between all our components. They can pass to children, so they need to be set up using a parent-child like relationship. Once they are passed they they can be accessed using {{}}.

# Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used much like HTML elements to display real time information to the user. We can do this by simply naming a prop and defining its type. Then we can place the component  of the prop we are looking for inside brackets {{prop.feature}} to give us access to that props attributes.
