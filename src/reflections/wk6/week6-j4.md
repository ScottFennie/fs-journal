## Nesting Routes In Vue

# What is a nested route?

A nested route is a route that allows for more complicated/complex user interfaces, allowing for components to be injected/nested inside of each other.

# When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

If you are looking to build a large database platform, you will certainly need to have some way to efficiently draw in all of the components you are needing onto the page without having 5000 lines of code. If you are making a website like Facebook, this may be needed to ease the production process.

# Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can. This can become incredibly useful when you are trying to make complex and dynamic websites. This allows for specific figures to effect each component.
