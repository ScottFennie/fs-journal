# Small Team SCRUM

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

When working on a smaller Scrum team, you often times have more work to take on individually given the size of your team. Because of this members of a small team must get creative in their process, often carrying multiple Scrum roles.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

It is incredibly important that all team members understand the scope of the mission, and are on the same page when it comes to the tasks they are managing. While running two sprints at once can  be potentially more efficient, it can also get incredibly confusing, and overwhelming for the team.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?##

The three tenants of this triangle are:

1) Good service cheap won't be fast

-You need to ensure that you have enough time to do good work.

2) Good service fast won't be cheap

-If you need to accomplish good work in a short amount of time, you will need a large team working long hours.

3) Fast service cheap won't be good

-You cannot have a good product that isnt rushed if you do not have the team to work on it.
