# First Capstone Reflection

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

On this project we ahve been using a significant amount of different technologies. To build out our basic application we ahve used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Vue. To draw our map we have been using the map APIs from arcGIS and Mapbox.

## What went well so far?

So far we have done a fantastic job organizing into small teams and accomplishing the basics of our app. We were able to quickly build and test our server/client side, geeting our app looking like the FIgma rather quickly. 

## What would you do differently? Why?

I think we could definitely benefit from more of an extended backlog. Occaisionally we get done with objectives faster than we anticipated, and our left wondering exactly waht we should each individually be working on.
