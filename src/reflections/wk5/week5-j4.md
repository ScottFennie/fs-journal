## Mongo Properties

# What is a virtual property?

Virtuals allow you to essentially create auto-completion models within mongoose that can be easily called upon to update information.

# When might you use a virtual property?

You may use a virtual property to store user information such as the username and picture that can be called upon almost like a user-model.

# How do you search by a virtual properties value?

To call a virtual property you must set a magic string. THis magic string can invoke the model. We did this a few times this week while building schema models to update the userID.
