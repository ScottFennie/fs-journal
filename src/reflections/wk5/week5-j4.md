## Its Query Time!

# What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query allows you to pass certain info directly to a website simply by appending or changing the end of a URl.

# What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

Each query parameter appears in the Url as a key value pair that looks something like "key=value". If a url has multiple query parameters, they are simply separated with a &.

# When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

This could be really be useful for allowing quick changes directly in the url. You could also target this to change by simply adding a /${change} to a listener to change the page based upon input.
