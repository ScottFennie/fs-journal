# I finally GIT it!

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use git as a way to store changes to our codebase locally. GIT allows us to come back later to see/reload changes to our code, almost like a magic time machine. It definitely saves programmers brutal headaches.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Branches allow us to separate out our code. this allows us to test individual features without impacting the overall structure of or total code.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub

GitHub basically takes the local code data stored through Git and publishes it to the cloud. Publishing to the cloud keeps the code "safe" and allows for greater collaboration.
