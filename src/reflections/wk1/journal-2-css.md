# Whats up with CSS?!


## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

psuedo classes are basically specific words that can be added to selectors that specifies the state of the elements within.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity basically gives the css code weight. If you have two elements in css that target the same class, but one has higher specificity, this one will be used. You can use this to organize your css by importance.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

you could essentially have conflicting css specificity, as your elements would all have unlimited weight. This give you infinite headaches as it would make deciding what css code is applied to an element incredibly difficult.
