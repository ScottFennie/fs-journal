# Whats up with CSS?!


## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Honestly, I think it has to be to not blow up icons that are meant to be small. I ran into this problem today when building my website, and it made it look like garbage. Sometimes you want to show off your high quality icons by making them bigger, but they actually look waaaaay worse.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

1) Use accent borders to add flare to your simple website.

2) Don't color every button, instead get creative with the placement.

3) Use websites like pallette picker to find colors that pair well together like a fine wine and cheese.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design is incredibly important. You can convey a lot about your brand simply though design. In fact, users almost expect certain design features for certain industries. If you miss the mark on design, you may lose users and sales.
