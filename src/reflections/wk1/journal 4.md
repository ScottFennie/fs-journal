# Hanging in the wireframe


## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

A wireframe lets you visualize the design of a website before you build it. It is a way of getting your ideas onto a page to see what looks good.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

1) Low fidelity wireframe
2) Medium fidelity wireframe
3) High fidelity wireframe

Each level gets a little more detailed allowing you to add minimal functionality and see what it should look like when it is more polished.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think it all depends on the complexity of the website, and if you are working in a team or solo developing. If you are attempting to work cooperatively on a project, or if you are designing a complex website, a wireframe is WELL worth your time. For simple websites they might not be necessary, but they can still help.
