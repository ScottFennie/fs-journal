# I PROMISE this is gonna hurt!


## What are the three states of a Promise?

1) Pending
2) Resolved
3) Rejected

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

If we are handling multiple operations, we can attatch each callback rather than passing them, or chaining them. This makes our code much more organized/readable.

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

Catch() is used when a promise is rejected, and Then() is used when a promise is resolved.
