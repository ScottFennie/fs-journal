## Finally I can REST!

# What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

rest stands for representational state transfer. It means that the application exposes information about itself and its resources. 

# What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means that the server does not remember anything about the user who uses/used an API.

# What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

Restful APIs have some unique identifier on the end that signals to the user that it is in a restful state.
