## Async and Wait!

# What is the purpose of Async/Await?

Async/Await drastically reduces the boilerplate around promises, reducing the amount of code written. 

# What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

All you need to do is to place "async" before the function, and "await" before the argument you are  trying to call.

# What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

Async and await simplifies the entire process of communicating with servers. With only a few lines of code you can get and push information from databases. Async and await also makes debugging much easier as you can catch errors.
