# Javascript AIN'T Easy

## What is Scope ?

Scope is basically how each variable is available. They can essentially be available locally or globally.

## What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is essentially moving the variable to the top of the scope within a line of code before the code is executed. 

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

you would use a const variable in a case where you do not want the variable to be changed in another block. Let variables are more lose and can basically be changed anywhere.
