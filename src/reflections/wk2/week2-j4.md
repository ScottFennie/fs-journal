# Beginner Mistakes!

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Planning can drastically cut programming time by reducing the amount of possibly errors and confusion caused by spaghetti code or a poor infrastructure.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Usually i will google the problem and investigate how other (better) programmers went about an issue. I won't directly copy any code, but it does allow me to learn about techniques I have not used.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

As a new developer, I am prone to making incredible errors. By simply creating a game plan and a code outline before I dive into a project, I can make my life (and the lives of my co-coders) much easier. I also need to have a mindset of a constant learner. It is almost impossible to be an expert in every area of coding.
