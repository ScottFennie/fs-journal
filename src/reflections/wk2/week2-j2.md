# Take me to Function-Town

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

1) Function declaration:

defines a named function.

2) Function expression:

defines a named or anonymous function.

3) Arrow function expression:

A shorter syntax for writing function expressions.



## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when describing the function, arguments are essentially what the given function will do.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. Array filters are an example of this.
