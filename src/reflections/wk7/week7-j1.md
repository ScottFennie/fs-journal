## Its better in a pair!

# What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two developers work together on the same application on one work station, switching off. The two roles consist of a driver and a navigator who watches the driver codes, looking for errors and advising on the best path forward.

# What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

One of the main benefits I have found when Pair programming is the reduction in small errors. When a navigator is actively watching for mistakes in spelling and code, you can often times avoid hours of tedious debugging.

# What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Both partners must be on the same page going in, otherwise roles can often times get blurred and opinions can turn a fun time into an inefficient mess.
