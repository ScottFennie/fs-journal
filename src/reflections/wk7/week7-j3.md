## How to design a strong user experience

# What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

A strong UX or user experience is all about designing you website or application in a way that allows for a seamless user experience. In other words your code does'nt interfere with what the user is attempting to do on your website.

# What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

A strong user experience can help foster a strong lasting relationship between the user and your "product". Youtube is a great example of this. Their app is so seamless and easy to use that I really have no interest in switching to spotify even if their service was better in almost every way.

# Why is the User Experience important?

The User experience is everything when designing a product for the public. Not everyone is a developer, so you need to make your product in a way that is functional and fun to use if you want your "product" to take off.
