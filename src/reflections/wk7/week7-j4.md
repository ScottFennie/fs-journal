## The Sprintr Challenge

# Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We certainly implemented many of the tips form the partner programming reading. Before we started the project we clearly defined our roles and were vocal about the direction we wanted to go in.

# What went well?

We started off really well when designing the server. THings started to fall apart a little as we got further into the weeds.

# What would you do differently?

In the future I will make sure to write up a list of the tasks that need to be completed, and I will assing the tasks to each partner based on what they think they can do best. This way everyone would be responsible for a given number of tasks.
