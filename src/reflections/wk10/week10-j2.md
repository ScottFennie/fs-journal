# C# List

## What is a List in C#?

A list in C# is esentially a data storage mechanism comparable to an array in JavaScript (although we have those in c# too). Lists also allow you to map specified objects into them from classes/models you create.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Where do I even start?! I can see myself using just about every list method as I get deep into larger projects, but for now just having the add and remove options instead of shift and push is amazing. I can also imagine using all of the find/sort methods frequently.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

To retrieve a single item, I believe that the list.Find method would be the most efficient. If I am looking to find several items that match a requirement, I would probably use FindByIndex.
