# C# Enums

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. In other words Enums are like variables that can store specific values and can only be called and assigned to these specific values. I like to picture a drop down menu. You still have options, but your selection is defined and limited.

## How can you modify an Enum?

Enums are designed so that they cannot be changed after build time, however  you can design an enum so that you can change it based upon an input number.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I havent yet used enums in my afternoon challenges this week, but I can imagine how I could use them in the future. For example, when picking profile options from a dropdow, or assigning "reputation" to a particular user, Enums could become incredibly useful.
