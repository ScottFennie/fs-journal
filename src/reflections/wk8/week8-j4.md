## Vue Testing

# What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

1) Unit Testing

-Allows you to test individual units of code in isolation

2) Component Testing

-Allows you to test each component within your application

3) End-to-end Testing

-Provides you with a holistic testing view of your application


# What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I personally think that unit testing is the most effective, as it allows you to catch any small errors along the way. Theoretically if all of your code works along the way, you should have LIMITED problems with your overall application.

# What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

End-to-end testing is good if you use it in conjunction with the other testing methods. If used in isolation it could take you months to fix any errors that you find in your complete application depending on its size.
