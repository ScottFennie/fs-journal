## Unit Testing

# What is Software Development Testing?

Testing is essentially testing your "product" on the devices that you are targeting with your development. You need to test to ensure that your code isn't just pretty, that it actually accomplishes your goals.

# What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

Unit testing is incredibly important nad can save you ALOT of time. IF you test each small chunk of code to ensure that it is functional, you can ensure that you are not wasting time later backtracking through your entire project if something is broken. You will be able to pin-point your mistake quickly.

# What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

Testing can certainly be time consuming. Depending on your target platform it can also be expensive. For example, I want to develop a VR game, but I don't have a headset. If I wanted to accurately test my application, I would need to go out and spend about $500!
