## SCRUM for Small Teams

# Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication can make or break a small team. You can accomplish a surprising amount with a relatively small team, but each member must know EXACTLY what they should be working on at any given moment. As soon as things start to overlap, you drastically reduce the efficiency of the team.

# What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

First, you need to ensure that your communication is flawless, this will save you time, ensuring that your meetings are as meaningful as possible. Secondly, you may need to run 2 sprints at once. This will ultimately be up to the scrum master, but this may give you the edge you need to remain as efficient as a larger team.

# What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The three tenants of this triangle are as follows:

1) Good service cheap won't be fast

In other words, if you don't have a large budget, you may have to wait for good results.

2) Good service fast won't be cheap

In other words, If you have a tight timeline, you may need to pay more so that more devs can accomplish the task in time.

3) Fast service cheap won't be good

In other words, if you are getting cheap, fast service, it is probably rushed and low quality.
