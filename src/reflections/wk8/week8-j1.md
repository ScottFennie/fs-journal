## Building Your Developer Portfolio

# What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

The major thing that a developer portfolio provides is credibility. A good portfolio shows that you know what you are doing and gives you authority in the industry. A good portfolio also helps you stand out from the crowd. 

# What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

What makes your portfolio effective entirely depends upon what you are trying to accomplish with your portfolio. If you are casting a wide net when looking for a job, you have more flexibility with your portfolio, and are able to display your best projects in multiple categories. If you are looking for a specific  position, you may want to only show projects that display that you are capable at the skills the job requires.

# What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would probably only display our most recent check points. I would only show these last few checkpoints and the capstone as these are the only projects that show that I am a full stack developer, which is the position I am trying to land.
